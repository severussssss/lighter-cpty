# Order Routing Analysis
Date: 2025-07-03

## Key Finding
Orders are NOT currently being routed through our local CPTY, even though it's connected to Architect Core.

## Evidence

1. **CPTY WAS Working Earlier**: 
   - We see logs showing orders were placed through the CPTY
   - Orders for account `2f018d76-5cf9-658a-b08e-a04f36782817` were processed
   - Cancel all functionality was working

2. **Current State**:
   - CPTY has 2 established connections from Architect Core
   - Test orders are NOT appearing in CPTY logs
   - Orders are being placed successfully but through a different route

## The Flow Issue

**What's Happening:**
```
Architect Client → Architect Core → [Different Venue Connection] → Lighter
                                ↗
                    Our CPTY (connected but not receiving orders)
```

**What Should Happen:**
```
Architect Client → Architect Core → Our CPTY → Lighter
```

## Possible Reasons

1. **Multiple Venue Connections**: Architect Core might have multiple Lighter connections and is routing to a different one

2. **Account/Trader Mapping**: Our CPTY might not be registered for the specific trader/account we're testing with

3. **Venue Priority**: Architect Core might prioritize other venue connections over ours

## How Architect Core Routes Orders

Based on the CPTY code:
1. Architect Core sends a `CptyLoginRequest` with trader and account info
2. CPTY logs in and becomes ready to receive orders for that trader/account
3. Orders for that trader/account are then routed to the CPTY

## Current CPTY Status
- Implementation is complete and working
- Previously handled orders successfully
- Ready to process orders when properly routed

## To Fix Routing
1. Ensure CPTY is the only/primary Lighter connection in Architect Core
2. Verify trader/account mapping in Architect Core configuration
3. Check if there are multiple LIGHTER venue connections
4. Restart both Architect Core and CPTY to re-establish routing

The CPTY implementation is correct - this is a routing/configuration issue in Architect Core.
