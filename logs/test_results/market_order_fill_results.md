## Implementation Notes

### Current Status:
- ✅ Trade is detected in WebSocket updates
- ✅ Trade details (price, size, trade_id) are captured

### Enhancement Opportunities:
1. Match trades to orders using order tracking
2. Send fill notifications to Architect Core with execution details
3. Calculate and report slippage/price improvement

## Log Evidence
```
'type': 'trade', 'market_id': 21, 'size': '24.0', 'price': '1.18907'
[INFO] Processing new trade 45780028
[WARNING] Could not match trade 45780028 to any known order
```

The warning indicates the CPTY received the trade but couldn't match it to the original order. This could be improved by tracking order IDs through the fill process.
