# Cancel All Orders Test Results
Date: 2025-07-02

## Summary
The native `cancel_all_orders` functionality has been successfully implemented and tested with Architect Core and Lighter CPTY.

## Implementation Details

### CPTY Method: `on_cancel_all_orders()`
- Receives `CancelAllOrdersRequest` from Architect Core
- Parameters: `account`, `execution_venue`, `trader` (all optional)
- Sends cancel all transaction to Lighter with:
  - `time_in_force=0` (cancel all orders regardless of TIF)
  - `time=0` (cancel immediately)

### Key Fix
Initial implementation used `time=None` which caused a TypeError. The Lighter API expects an integer value, so it was changed to `time=0`.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Simple Cancel All
- Placed 1 order
- Called `cancel_all_orders(synthetic=False)`
- Result: Success

### Test 2: Comprehensive Cancel All (5 orders)
- **Before Cancel**: 99 total orders on LIGHTER
- **Placed**: 5 test orders with prices from 0.50 to 0.54
- **Cancel All Request**: Sent successfully
- **After Cancel**: 94 total orders (5 cancelled)
- **Confirmation**: All 5 orders logged as cancelled

## Verification
1. ✅ Architect Core properly routes `CancelAllOrdersRequest` to CPTY
2. ✅ CPTY successfully processes the request
3. ✅ Lighter API accepts the cancel all transaction
4. ✅ Orders are marked as cancelled locally
5. ✅ Order count reflects successful cancellation
6. ✅ Individual order cancellation confirmations received

## Connection Details
- CPTY listening on port 50051
- 2 established connections from Architect Core (ec2-54-178-56-155.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
- Running in tmux session: `l_cpty`

## Conclusion
The cancel_all functionality is fully operational and provides significant efficiency improvements over synthetic mode (individual cancels).
